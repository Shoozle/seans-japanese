            <h2 class="intro">Hi, my name is Sean. こんにちわ、シオーン です。Because I lost a bet in 2021, I have to try and become fluent in
                Japanese by the end of 2022. How much is considered fluent? I don't know. But I am trying. </h2>
            <p>For speaking and correct pronunciation, I have been using the Michel Thomas method. This is a collection
                of 8 discs that mimic a classroom environment of 1 teacher and 2 students engaging in conversations,
                learning new vocabulary and fixing common mistakes. It's probably my favourite way to learn but it does
                not teach writing and since it's only audio, I did find myself losing attention on walks.</p>

                Thomas Method</a>
            <p>In terms of writing structure, I have been following the 'Organic Japanese with Cure Dolly' YouTube
                course. This is a collection of 93 videos which attempts to teach Japanese sentence structure in a
                simple way and often does. But sometimes the analogies go a bit over my head and the presentation style
                of an AI synth with a modified voice teaching you is hard to get over.</p>

                target="_blank">>>> Cure Dolly</a>
            <p>Lastly, I have been using multiple mobile apps to learn phrases, memorise the alphabets and revise what I
                learn out there. This includes doing multiple sessions a day on Duolingo. I am currently onto the second
                unit for Japanese there. I don't think Duolingo is good for learning a language, only memorising, but it
                is
                a really good revising tool and the competitive leaderboard is motivating. </p>
            <p>All three combined are very helpful but there's so much to learn; when to use Katakana or Hiragana, what
                each of them look and sound like, and the little tittle modifications that change a sound from a 'ki' to
                a 'gi' or a 'ho' to a 'po', and the correct marker for correct sentence flow. e.g. using 'o' or 'wo'
                when talking about an object, but then 'ni' when someone is doing something. It's a lot to take in, but
                I am proud of the progress in just 2 months. By the end of the year, I would love to be able to play a
                game with a simplified Japanese language option like the newer Pokemon games, and fully understand it.
            </p>
            <p>...Though Elden Ring is out on Friday, so I am about to forget and abandon everything.</p>
